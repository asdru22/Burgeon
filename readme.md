Burgeon expands the definition of flora in Minecraft, transforming plants from static scenery into active tools for survival, combat, and cultivation. The pack introduces a variety of organic equipment and interactive blocks that bridge the gap between nature and technology.

### **Living Weaponry and Utilities**
Plants in Burgeon are often harvested for their latent abilities, serving as biological alternatives to standard gear.

* **The Bursting Blossom:** This plant functions as a volatile explosive. When powered by redstone, it pops and shoots 6 homing petals, dealing damage to hostile entities nearby before destroying itself.
* **Healing Flora:**
    * **Blooming Bulb:** This item acts as a potent regenerative consumable. Using it instantly heals the player 6 health.
    * **Scarlet Fang:** This weapon drains the player's health to spawn a homing spore that damages hit enemies while also restoring the consumed health.
* **Rootsplit Sickle:** This weapon can be used on its own, but also combined into a **Rootsplit Staff**. Upon being combined, it grants the player a burst of **Speed** and **Hunger**
* **Pointerpod:** Acting as a navigational trinket, this item can be used to guide the player toward a mysterious structure.

### **Functional Decoration**
The new decorative blocks are designed with intricate interaction mechanics, serving as the backbone for the pack's "tech" progression.

* **The Spile:** Far from a simple aesthetic tap, the Spile is a functional device used for resource extraction. When placed on a **Creaking Heart** that is in an "awake" state, it has a chance to fill a bottle with **Goop**. However, here is a 5% chance the Spile will drain the life from the tree, converting the Heart into a Pale Oak Log.
* **The Etched Vase:** This block serves as a highly interactive planter. Unlike standard flower pots, the Etched Vase accepts different types of **soil** and **seeds**. It can be powered by Redstone to remove harbored plants and allows the player to use **Goop** (extracted via the Spile) to accelerate the growth of the planted seeds
